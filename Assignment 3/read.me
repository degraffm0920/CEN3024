Write a program that does spell checking. The program should do spell checking as follows,

The program should accept two text file names on the command line
The program should read both files into string variables. The first is the file to check, and the second is the dictionary. (Sample file  testStates.txtPreview the document and  dictionary.txtPreview the document)
Both strings should be split into lists of words (two ArrayList collections)
Implement your main loop. For each word in the document file, if that word doesn't exist in the dictionary, print it out, saying that it is an unknown word
Submit your source code and a couple of screen shots showing your program in action
Add your spell checker application to your GitHub repo. Submit a screen shot
